# 🌬️ Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to assess the viability of small-scale wind projects. Many potential projects fail due to the absence of simple and reliable forecasting tools. This dashboard addresses that gap by integrating **historical wind data**, **statistical forecasting models**, and **turbine power curve analysis** into a single interface.  

The tool empowers stakeholders to make **data-driven decisions** about renewable energy investments, contributing to sustainable development and clean energy adoption.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Small-scale wind projects often remain unrealized because investors and communities lack accessible tools to evaluate their feasibility. Without clear forecasts of wind speeds and generation potential, wind energy resources are underutilized.  

---

## 💡 Solution  
The dashboard provides a **location-based assessment platform** where users can:  
- View **historical wind speed patterns**.  
- Generate **time-series forecasts** (using ARIMA or ML models).  
- Estimate **energy output potential** for wind turbines using power curves.  
- Interact with a **visual dashboard** built with tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python frameworks (Streamlit/Dash).

## 📂 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  
1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Collect historical wind speed and weather data (e.g., NOAA, OpenWeather, or local sources).  

2. **Statistical Modeling**  
   - Apply time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, ML-based methods) for wind speed forecasting.  

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Build an interactive visualization showing capacity factors, turbine output, and forecasted trends.  

4. **User Testing & Refinement**  
   - Improve dashboard usability based on stakeholder feedback.
